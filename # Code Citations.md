Your `script.js` already sets dark mode as default! However, to make sure it's truly the default from the start, I'll make a small adjustment to ensure dark mode applies immediately without any flashing.

Add this `<meta>` tag to your `index.html` in the `<head>` section, and update your `script.js`:

````html
<!-- filepath: c:\Users\nyaup\OneDrive\Desktop\webprojects\portfolio\index.html -->
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <meta name="color-scheme" content="dark light" />
    <!-- ...existing code... -->
````

Then
```
